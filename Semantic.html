                <h2>About Impact of Games</h2>
                <p>
                    Gaming Communities: Online multiplayer games have created vast communities where players interact, collaborate, and
                    compete with each other. Games like Fortnite, World of Warcraft, and League of Legends have spawned massive online
                    communities that shape the culture of gaming, from eSports to fan art and online streaming platforms like Twitch.<br>
                    
                    Genres and Trends: The popularity of certain game genres can shape the landscape. For example, battle royale games like
                    PUBG and Apex Legends gained massive popularity, influencing game design across the industry. The same can be said for
                    the rise of "games as service," where titles like Fortnite or Destiny provide ongoing content and live events.<br>

                    Live Streaming: Platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok have given rise to game streaming as a form of entertainment.
                    Players can watch others play games, join in on discussions, or get tips and tricks for their favorite titles. This has
                    become a multi-billion-dollar industry and a career for many content creators.<br>
